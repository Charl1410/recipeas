## Description
I am currently working on a small nextjs application to display recipes! This application will be able to filter recipes based on a variation of different criteria such as:

* Level of difficulty
* Cooking time
* Meal type
* Calories per serving and more! 
 
 I will be implimenting dynamic routing to display the full recipe. For the back end I am using a dummy JSON end point: https://dummyjson.com/recipes. 


## Initialisation

## Dependencies 
This application is using: 

* axios 
* Tailwind
* Mantine Core 
*  


## User Story

 * Users should be able to enter the application and be able to navigate to recipeas based on meal type and cuisine
 * Users will have an account section
 * Users are able to see all recpies and filter based on different criteria
 * Users should be able to fill out a contact form that build a local JSON file of responses
 * Users will be able to have their own account where their favourite meals are stores 
 * Users should be able to add recipes to a favourites section
