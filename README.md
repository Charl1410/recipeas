## Description
I am currently working on a small nextjs application to display recipes! This application will be able to filter recipes based on a variation of different criteria such as:
* Level of difficulty
* Cooking time
* Meal type
* Calories per serving and more! 
 
 I will be implimenting dynamic routing to display the full recipe. For the back end I am using a dummy JSON end point: https://dummyjson.com/recipes.
